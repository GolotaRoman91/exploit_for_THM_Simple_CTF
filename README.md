I posted this code because while going through the Simple CTF room on the THM expoit I found on exploit-DB 
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46635
contain errors
I fixed the errors and now it runs correctly with python3.
 
Example of use 
python3 exploit.py -u http://%YOUR_URL_ADRESS/simple --crack -w %PATH_TO_WORDLIST

Maybe this will help someone when passing the room
